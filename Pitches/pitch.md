## Pitch - NCNF App

It's been more than a year now that COVID started spreading all overall the world : thanks to this pandemic, instead of going at the movie theater or visiting a museum, the main thing we have been doing was wasting our time, watching netflix stuck at home. The major part of cultural events have been canceled and our social life hasn't been exciting lately. But this might change : in the next few months, stores will reopen and they will be a high demand and offering of cultural entertainment. This is where our app comes in. Currently, I have to visit multiple platforms in order to see what's going on around me. We would like to offer an app that regroups all cultural events in a complete catalogue that is easy to use.

For a year now we have been stuck in worldwide pandemic and culture has been one of the first casualties of it. Since march of last year, all cultural events have been put on hold and I think we can all agree that it is something we all miss dearly. With the imminent reopenings of many museums, theatres, movie theatres, etc there will high offering as well as demand for cultural events. This is where our app comes in.
Currently, I have to visit multiple platforms in order to get a local program. We would like to offer an app that regroups all cultural events in a complete catalogue that is easy to use.
