# Pitch - NCNF App

For a year now we have been stuck in worldwide pandemic and culture has been one of the first casualties of it. Since march of last year, all cultural events have been put on hold and I think we can all agree that it is something we all miss dearly. This is where our app comes in. 

Let’s say I’m a user who is looking for events nearby. To do so, I have to visit multiple platforms in order to get the local program. We would like to offer an app that regroups all cultural events at the same place.

## Conclusion

Have a good day everyone.
