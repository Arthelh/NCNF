This week, I worked on the UI for the group feature. For now, it is mostly foccused on functionality as opposed to aesthetics. Apart from some small testing dissifuclties which I managed to solve in the end, everything went as expected without any particular difficulties. However, some of the classes I wrote will need to be refactored once we create a GroupRepository (as of right now I'm still injecting a DatabaseService).

There are still some issues with the linking of the groups to the database. I hope to fix those next week, as well as making the UI a bit nicer to look at.
