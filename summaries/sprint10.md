# Summary for Week 10

## Beltan (Scrum Master)

This week I finished the last links of the map to the database, namely showing the organizations on the map, now that the organizations view and entity has been created. I also finished the date filtering by implementing the actual filtering in addition to just the layout. Overall it went okay but because of weird issues with my Android Studio and other things it ended up taking me much more than it was supposed to.

This week, I worked on the UI for the group feature. For now, it is mostly foccused on functionality as opposed to aesthetics. Apart from some small testing dissifuclties which I managed to solve in the end, everything went as expected without any particular difficulties. However, some of the classes I wrote will need to be refactored once we create a GroupRepository (as of right now I'm still injecting a DatabaseService).

There are still some issues with the linking of the groups to the database. I hope to fix those next week, as well as making the UI a bit nicer to look at.

## Overall team

This week went very well. One of the big tasks we had to do was the folder restructuring which made a bottleneck where we all had to finish our tasks, do this refactor, and then only start working again, but it went well and it is now done. Everyone continued working on their respective tasks and we are coming ever closer to the final product.
