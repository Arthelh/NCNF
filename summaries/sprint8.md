## Summary for Week 8

# Beltan

This week I worked on modifying the settings and linking the Map and Feed to the DataBase. The first task went well. I implemented it without much trouble and it only took a little more time than expected. The second task was much more harduous than expected because it required modification of many other classes and modifying them made the tests not pass anymore. The task itself is done, but I still need to do modifications so that tests pass and we can merge.

My time estimates this week were quite off. I ended up spending much more time than expected because of all the inter-dependencies the second task had.

This week I continued working on the activity that tracks a user's friends. Since there are a lot of resources about this type of feature on the Internet, it was not that difficult. However, testing it was very difficult, and I still haven't been able to find a good way to test the UI features. I'll keep working on that next week. My time estimate was off, because I did not expect the testing to be that difficult.
