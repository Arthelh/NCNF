This week, I worked on the layout of the application and changed activities to use fragments, allawing us to have a bottom navigation bar that looks way cleaner than a main activity with buttons. This took me some time since I had to refactor the existing activities but I think this is a nice layout on which we can build on top of. 

I encountered a problem with the map fragment since every time we change to another one, the whole fragment, including the map, is reloaded. This will be a little task to work on later in order to save the position and "freeze" the fragment and reload it to the exact same state using caching.

My time estimates were pretty close to the actual time spent on this tasks.
