# Summary for Week 11

## Beltan



## David



## Eloi 

This week, I worked on finishing the javadoc and the tests from last week. I also started the group creation UI and back-end : I didn't have time to finish it before the meeting, several tests are missing but the main part is done. 


## Emmanuelle

This week, I worked on improving the UI for the friends tracking activity, including implementing map markers that feature the profile picture of the person whose location it shows. This was a bit more difficult than expected, but at the end I found a way to make it work. I also made sure that this activity was correctly linked with the database.

## Jérémie 

This week, I worked mainly on improving the aesthetics of the UI for displaying Events and Users. I matched the existing UI of the UserProfile to have aconsistent presentation accross the application. My two PRs are ready but waiting for reviews and for Cirrus to run the tests.

It took me a little bit more than the expected time but overall this was a good week.
