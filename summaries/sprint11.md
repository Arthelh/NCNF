# Summary for Week 11

## Beltan

This week I mostly tried to make my pr work. I had many issues with my installation of Android Studio with lint not functioning and jacoco seemingly ignoring unit tests. It took me a lot of extra time to fix this. Fortunately I did not have many other tasks for this week so this did not hinder my work too much, it just took me much more time than anticipated. Other than that I was tasked with checking how the app works when we're offline and when we're online first, lose connection and then reconnect, to see if everything worked correctly and did not crash. I uncovered one bug that made the app crash when offline and I fixed it.

My time estimate were way off this week because of the weird issues I encountered with Android Studio and Cirrus. It took me about ten hours to manage to go around them. Other than that it went fine

## David

This week I finished the organization part of the user profile. I fixed some bugs with the fragments replacements and displays. Next week I'll work on the design of th organization profile.


## Eloi 

This week, I worked on finishing the javadoc and the tests from last week. I also started the group creation UI and back-end : I didn't have time to finish it before the meeting, several tests are missing but the main part is done. 


## Emmanuelle

This week, I worked on improving the UI for the friends tracking activity, including implementing map markers that feature the profile picture of the person whose location it shows. This was a bit more difficult than expected, but at the end I found a way to make it work. I also made sure that this activity was correctly linked with the database.

## Jérémie 

This week, I worked mainly on improving the aesthetics of the UI for displaying Events and Users. I matched the existing UI of the UserProfile to have aconsistent presentation accross the application. My two PRs are ready but waiting for reviews and for Cirrus to run the tests.

It took me a little bit more than the expected time but overall this was a good week.
