# Summary for Week 11

## Beltan

This week I mostly tried to make my pr work. I had many issues with my installation of Android Studio with lint not functioning and jacoco seemingly ignoring unit tests. It took me a lot of extra time to fix this. Fortunately I did not have many other tasks for this week so this did not hinder my work too much, it just took me much more time than anticipated. Other than that I was tasked with checking how the app works when we're offline and when we're online first, lose connection and then reconnect, to see if everything worked correctly and did not crash. I uncovered one bug that made the app crash when offline and I fixed it.

My time estimate were way off this week because of the weird issues I encountered with Android Studio and Cirrus. It took me about ten hours to manage to go around them. Other than that it went fine
