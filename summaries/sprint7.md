## Summary for Week 7

# Beltan


# David (scrum master)

This week I started working on the whole Organization interface. This required some restructuring of the user profile to incorporate organizations. The token system still needs to be 
determined and then implemented. Next week I might be able to request a PR with the Organization UI.


# Eloi 


# Emmanuelle 


# Jérémie


# Keran


# Overall team

This week's workflow was much better than last's. Eloi and Jérémie spent a lot of time refactoring the whole database interface and testing it. Keran also completed a caching system that
hopefully will fulfill the requirements.  
Overall, The project appears to be back on track, however we must remain careful with our planning to avoid making the same mistakes again. We still have core features and requirements to 
complete and we will prioritize those above the rest.
