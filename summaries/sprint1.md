# Overall team

We implemented only part of the user stories we had assigned to this sprint as they will probably span over the course
of a few weeks. The start of the implementation for each of the features went seemingly very well and we seem on a good
track to kickstart this project. 

We also all have a good view of what our next individual tasks will be for sprint2

Our time estimates were not very accurate and will probably remain so for a couple weeks before we get better estimating
skills.

We had three standup meetings: on Monday, on Wednesday and on Friday, before the course meeting. This was a bit too much in
retrospect as for the first meeting most people did not start working because of other projects and courses taking the priority.
It did give however a strong sense of teamwork and I think everyone felt well settled into the team, in part thanks to them.
