## Summary for Week 1

# Beltan (Scrum Master)

I implemented the view of the interactive map that will show position and nearby events.
My time estimate was fairly accurate, 4h estimated v 5h actual. 

My tasks are well laid out for next week and I have a good view of the next steps I'll be implementing in the interactive map.

I implemented the Event entity and a very basic UI to display it.

The entity part of my task went very smotthly (although it did take a little longer than expected), however when creating the UI I realized that it was not worth spending excessive time on making things look pretty before all of us agree on a design template. I also did not manage to write tests for the UI yet.

Next time, I will try to manage my time better in order to have finished tests before the end of the week.

# Overall team

We implemented only part of the user stories we had assigned to this sprint as they will probably span over the course
of a few weeks. The start of the implementation for each of the features went seemingly very well and we seem on a good
track to kickstart this project. 

We also all have a good view of what our next individual tasks will be for sprint2

Our time estimates were not very accurate and will probably remain so for a couple weeks before we get better estimating
skills.

We had three standup meetings: on Monday, on Wednesday and on Friday, before the course meeting. This was a bit too much in
retrospect as for the first meeting most people did not start working because of other projects and courses taking the priority.
It did give however a strong sense of teamwork and I think everyone felt well settled into the team, in part thanks to them.
