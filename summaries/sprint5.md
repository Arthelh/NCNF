## Summary for Week 5

# Beltan

This week I changed the source of the events for the map, a thing that I did in the first week, to have it use the real event class that is used throughout the project. I also modified the source of the events,
that was before a placeholder class, to have it be the same source as the feed. I still have work to do for next week as I have not finished all my tasks.

# David (scrum master)
This week I tried to create and run tests for user search, I was unable to find any documentation on how to make espresso type in a searchview so I wasted most of my time. I then tried to make a generic interface for Adapter and FirestoreRecyclerView, but unfortunately this doesn't appear to be possible, at least not without extreme complexity or reduced abstraction. 
I then turned to the feed view and refactored the fetching, filtering and displaying of events.

# Overall team

This week was difficult, as a long time pending PR had to be merged. Unclear tasks, free cloud service limitations and impossible-to-test features greatly hindered progress. Many classes and features lacked insight and worked with lists of events instead of using db queries. The goal is now to refactor, clean and update all the previous code that's become "legacy", then define clear and focused goals for the upcoming weeks. This will require a complete rebuild of the Sprint Backlog and tasks
