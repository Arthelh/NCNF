## Summary for Week 5

# Beltan



# David (scrum master)
This week I tried to run tests for user search, I was unable to find any documentation on how to make espresso type in a searchview so I wasted most of my time. I then tried to make a generic interface for Adapter and FirestoreRecyclerView, but unfortunately this doesn't appear to be possible, or not without extreme cmplexity or reduced abstraction. 
I then turned to the feed view and refactored the fetching, filtering and displaying of events.

This week was difficult, as a long time pending PR had to be merged. Unclear tasks, free cloud service limitations and impossible-to-test features greatly hindered progress. Many classes and features lacked insight and worked with lists of events instead of using db queries. The goal is now to refactor, clean and update all the previous code that's become "legacy", then define clear and focused goals for the upcoming weeks. This will require a complete rebuild of the Sprint Backlog and tasks
