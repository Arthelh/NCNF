## Summary for Week 6

This week, I redid the UI for the event creation now that we know exactly what fields we want to put into it, and then I started working on the activity to track the location of your friends. I did not run into any major issues and I will be continuing the friend tracking activity next week.

# Overall team

At the beginning of the week, we refactored the Scrum Board which helped us organize a little bit better. However, we still have issues with some people not knowing what to do because their planned tasks ended up depending on other people's tasks. For next week, we will try to change that and make sure that everyone always knows what to do next, especially since there are still quite a few things left to do.
