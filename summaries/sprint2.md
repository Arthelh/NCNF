## Summary for Week 2

# Beltan

I continued the implementation of the map, namely the ToolBar and a setting that allows for a maximum distance to which
events are shown to be chosen. I ran into many issues for the ToolBar, apparently related to the Places API from Google.
I have not yet managed to resolve those issues.
The settings I have implemented without too many issues. A couple arose but I managed to resolve them.

I took a lot more time than expected on this toolbar, especially in trying to find the cause of the errors, which I have still
not been able to do. I name Google the cause for all of this

Except for that however my estimates were quite close to the time I ended up investing this week into the project.
