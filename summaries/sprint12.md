# Summary for Week 12

## Beltan

This week I finished a few bug fixes for the product which went fine and didn't take much more time than expected. The most of the work this week was doing the final modifications with the rest of the team and trying to get Cirrus to work. This took way more time than expected

## David

This week I completed the design for organizations profiles and list views. 


## Eloi 
This week was a bit tough with the final deadline. Because I didn't do a lot last week, I work a lot more this week : did a home UI refont and also finalize the creation of the groups. We had a lot of issuse with Cirrus not wanting to pass tests that pass locally. Overall, it was a bit of a final rush.


## Emmanuelle

This week I made the groups leavable for regular group users and editable as well as deletable for the owner of the group. I also added some tests to try to get our overall code coverage up, since we had to remove quite a few tests that never passed on Cirrus.


## Jérémie 
This last week of the semester was quite a rush, especially with Cirrus issues. I worked on the refont of various UI (login, event page) and added a button to save events to my bookmark. I also fixed some bugs with the login backend and UI.
