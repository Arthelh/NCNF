# Summary for Week 12

## Beltan


## David

This week I completed the design for organizations profiles and list views. 


## Eloi 
This week was a bit tough with the final deadline. Because I didn't do a lot last week, I work a lot more this week : did a home UI refont and also finalize the creation of the groups. We had a lot of issuse with Cirrus not wanting to pass tests that pass locally. Overall, it was a bit of a final rush.
