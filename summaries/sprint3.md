## Summary for Week 3

# Beltan

This week I finished the implementation of the AutoComplete part for the Map toolbar. It is now working correctly and 
when the user enters a location, the map is moved to it and the markers are updated accordingly.
I also worked on the look of the app and I think it turned out fairly well.

About my time estimates, this week I think they were fair.
