## Summary for Week 3

# Beltan

This week I finished the implementation of the AutoComplete part for the Map toolbar. It is now working correctly and 
when the user enters a location, the map is moved to it and the markers are updated accordingly.
I also worked on the look of the app and I think it turned out fairly well.

About my time estimates, this week I think they were fair.

I spent the whole week testing the Authentication module and refactoring the UI. The testing part was cumbersome to debug but the required coverage is achieved.

This was a big part of the project to merge and it took much more time than expected.

This week, the main task was to test and merge the Authentication and Database modules in order to build the rest of the application on top of it. The integration of Firebase services is now properly modularized and the Database can be used for our basic entities (Users, Events). This completes two high priority user stories.

Another goal was to finish the map user story, specifically the navigation and the selection of the radius we want events to be seen. This has been done and tested, completing another user story.

For the remaining user stories in the Sprint Backlog, the work is in progress but not done yet. These will require one more week to finish implementation and testing.

The time estimates were more accurate than last week but we still need time to ajust the user stories we put in the Sprint Backlog for them to be completable in one week.
