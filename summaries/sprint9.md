# Summary for Week 8

## Beltan

This week I finished linking the Database to the Map and Event Feed. The link itself was already done in the previous but to finish the implementation at the UI level I had to refactor the SocialObjectActivity into a fragment. 
This itself went fine, but it took me quite some time to fix the way it would show on the map and that ended up taking me quite some time. I also added in a little extra in that now the back arrow key also returns to the previous fragment
and doesn't just close the app if you're on the main activity.

Overall it took me a bit longer than expected, mostly because of the map and interactions I didn't know would happen that took me quite some time to fix.
